‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.xaml                 # Application definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.xaml.cs             # Application code-behind
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainWindow.xaml         # Main window UI definition

```

## File Descriptions

### MainWindow.xaml
Contains the user interface definition including:
- Toolbar with brush selection buttons
- Brush size slider
- Drawing canvas
- Layout and styling

### MainWindow.xaml.cs
Contains the application logic:
- Paint effect algorithms
- Mouse event handling
- Brush type management
- Visual effect generation

### App.xaml & App.xaml.cs
Standard WPF application bootstrap files.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Run the executable or press F5 in Visual Studio/VS Code

2. **Select Brush Type**
   - Click üåø **Foliage** for leaf-like green effects
   - Click üî• **Fire** for upward-moving flame particles
   - Click üí® **Smoke** for wispy, drifting gray effects

3. **Adjust Brush Size**
   - Use the slider to control effect intensity (5-50 pixels)

4. **Start Painting**
   - Click and drag on the white canvas
   - Each brush creates multiple particles with natural variations

5. **Clear Canvas**
   - Click **Clear** button to start over

## Technical Details

### Paint Effect Algorithms

**Foliage Effect**:
- Creates 8 elliptical shapes per mouse position
- Varies size and opacity for natural look
- Uses 5 different shades of green
- Applies radial gradients for depth

**Fire Effect**:
- Generates 6 flame-shaped particles
- Taller than wide with upward movement
- Uses red, orange, and yellow colors
- Positions flames to rise upward from cursor

**Smoke Effect**:
- Produces 5 wispy circular shapes
- Very transparent with gray coloring
- Drifts upward and outward naturally
- Varies in size and opacity

### Performance Considerations

- Effects create multiple visual elements during drawing
- Canvas children are managed automatically
- Clear function removes all elements and frees memory
- Optimized for smooth real-time interaction

## Customization

### Adding New Brush Types

1. Add new enum value to `BrushType`:
   ```csharp
   public enum BrushType
   {
       Foliage,
       Fire,
       Smoke,
       YourNewBrush  // Add here
   }
   ```

2. Create new effect method:
   ```csharp
   private void CreateYourNewBrushEffect(Point position, double brushSize)
   {
       // Your effect logic here
   }
   ```

3. Add button to XAML and wire up events

### Modifying Effect Parameters

- Change particle count in effect methods (loop iterations)
- Adjust color arrays for different palettes
- Modify size calculations for different brush behaviors
- Alter transparency values (Alpha channel)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**"InitializeComponent does not exist"**:
```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet build
```

**XAML Parse Errors**:
- Check all XML tags are properly closed
- Verify namespace declarations
- Ensure event handler names match

**Missing Controls**:
- Verify XAML element names match C# references
- Check x:Name attributes in XAML
- Rebuild solution

### Runtime Issues

**Application Won't Start**:
- Check App.xaml has correct StartupUri
- Verify target framework compatibility
- Check for missing dependencies

**Effects Not Working**:
- Verify mouse event handlers are connected
- Check canvas is properly initialized
- Ensure brush size slider has valid range

## Development Environment

### Recommended Extensions (VS Code)

- **C# Dev Kit**: Essential C# development tools
- **XAML**: Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- **GitLens**: Git integration (optional)
- **.NET Install Tool**: Manage .NET versions

### Build Commands

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Build project
dotnet build

# Run application
dotnet run

# Publish for distribution
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
